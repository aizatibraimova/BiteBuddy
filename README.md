## Services Used ‚õìÔ∏è

### OpenAI ChatGPT API

#### Configuration

To configure your application to use the ChatGPT's OpenAI API, follow these detailed steps:

1. **Generate a Master Key**

   If you do not already have a `master.key` file, you can generate one by running:

   ```bash
   EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit
   ```
   This command will open the credentials file in Visual Studio Code (replace "code --wait" with your preferred editor, such as nano). A new master.key file will be generated automatically if it does not exist.

2. **Add OpenAI API's Tokens**
    
    Inside the opened credentials file, add your API tokens and other sensitive configuration variables in a structured format. For example:
    ```bash
    open_ai_api_key: YOUR_OPENAI_API_ACCESS_KEY
    ```
    Save and close the file. The changes will be encrypted and saved securely, accessible only via the master.key.
 3. **Double check your configuration**

    If you would like to periodically check your key for reference you can run the command below and it should appear in your terminal.
    ```bash
    rails credentials:show
    ```

 4. **Ensure the Security of the Master Key**

    Never commit your master.key or the credentials file to version control. Add the master.key to your .gitignore file to prevent it from being accidentally pushed to your repository:
    ```bash
    echo 'config/master.key' >> .gitignore
    ```

## Installation

To set up BiteBuddy on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aizatibraimova/BiteBuddy.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd BiteBuddy
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

4. **Set up the database:**
    ```bash
    rails db:create
    rails db:migrate
    ```

5. **Seed the database with sample data:**
    ```bash
    rails db:seed
    ```

6. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    rails server
    ```

7. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
    ```bash
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use BiteBuddy to manage and track your child's meals and allergies.

### Key Sections:

- **Navigation:** Use the navigation bar to access different sections like Meals, Allergies, and Analyses.
- **Logging Meals:** Log meals, including the type of food, quantity, and time.
- **Tracking Allergies:** Enter and monitor allergic reactions, including symptoms and severity.
- **Viewing Analyses:** Get AI-driven analysis of logged meals and allergic reactions to identify patterns.

## Database

The database schema includes tables for `Users`, `Children`, `Foods`, `Meals`, `Allergies`, and `Analyses`. Each table is connected through appropriate associations, ensuring the integrity and relationships of the data.

### Key Tables:

- **Users:** Stores user credentials and profiles.
- **Children:** Information about the children being monitored.
- **Foods:** Catalog of foods consumed by the children.
- **Meals:** Logs of meals including the food, quantity, and time.
- **Allergies:** Records of allergic reactions with symptoms and severity.
- **Analyses:** AI-generated insights and patterns from the logged meals and allergic reactions.

### Process Flowchart üó∫Ô∏è

This flowchart provides a detailed overview of the core processes within the BiteBuddy application, visualized using Mermaid.js. As developers, understanding the flow of data and the sequence of operations is crucial for effective collaboration and feature implementation.

The flowchart represents the key stages in the user journey:
1. **User Sign-Up**: The entry point for new users, where they create an account.
2. **Child Management**: Users add their child to the system, which is essential for associating meals and allergies.
3. **Food Introduction**: Users log the foods they plan to introduce to their child.
4. **Meal Logging**: Users can log meals for their child using the foods they've added. This process is independent and can be performed at any time.
5. **Allergy Logging**: Users can log any allergic reactions their child experiences, also independent of meal logging.
6. **AI Analysis**: If the user requests it, the application runs an AI-driven analysis combining logged meals and allergies to generate insights.
7. **Result Display**: The analysis results are displayed to the user but are not stored in the system.
